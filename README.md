## Purpose of this app

UCHI SHOKU aims to make the communication easier between an eater and a cooker at home. The eater can request what he/she wants to eat for the dinner while the cooker can know what kind of ingredients are needed for requests. Basically, the cooker has the right to decide which request to accept.
