# UCHI SHOKU

This is an app that I created during the time as students at Code Chrysalis. It is an app for booking dinner at home.

## Purpose of this app

UCHI SHOKU is going to make the communication easier between the eater and the cooker at home. The eater can request what he/she wants to eat while the cooker can know what kind of ingredients are needed for the dinner. Basically, the cooker has the right to decide which request to accept.

## Current Features and Operation
Currently the app is in an early stage and it's functionality is still limited.

Basic:
 - Register an account
 - Login

[Eater]
 - Send a request
 - Edit a request
 - Delete a request

[Cooker]
 - Send a request
 - Edit a request
 - Delete a request
 - Accept a request

## Future Features
As this app matures I would like to add functionality for selecting recipes from external APIs.
